Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The objective of this project is to create a Twitter-based social network.

For the setup, the frontend must interact with a backend webservice via fetch, while clean code principles and TDD are encouraged for some specific functionalities, such as checking entered fields.

The login page allows users to create an account or sign in. Clicking the "Sign up" or "Sign in" buttons opens a modal with corresponding input fields. The application communicates with the backend, and if the information is correct, the user is redirected to the Home component. In the case of sign up, user information is saved to the database. A token is used, and passwords are hashed. Three components are used: "Login.js", "SignUp.js", and "SignIn.js".

The homepage is divided into three sections. The left section displays the user's information and a logout button, and the right section shows the "Trends," or hashtags used and their frequencies. In the middle section, users can add tweets and view the last tweets of all users. A tweet cannot exceed 280 characters, and liking and deleting functionalities are implemented for user-owned tweets. Four components are used: "Home.js", "LastTweets.js", "Tweet.js", and "Trends.js".

Finally, the hashtag page appears when the user clicks on a hashtag in the Trends section. This page has similar components to the homepage, with a search bar and a list of tweets containing the selected hashtag. The user can search for other hashtags using the search bar. If no tweet contains the searched hashtag, a message is displayed. Four components are used: "Hashtag.js", "LastTweets.js", "Tweet.js", and "Trends.js".
